    description: `Developed and evaluated a quantitative equity portfolio strategy using 
    Momentum and Volatility indicators. Integrated Alpha Vantage API for data retrieval 
    and applied Risk Parity for asset allocation. 

    Key Features:
    - Constructed a risk-parity portfolio with equal risk contribution per asset.
    - Backtested over 2 years with monthly rebalancing and a 6-month lookback window.
    - Included realistic transaction costs (0.001).
    - Used systematic selection and dynamic allocation to optimize return-risk balance.

    Outcome: Validated the efficiency of Risk Parity and systematic rebalancing in portfolio management.`,
